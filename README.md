## Order date: 03.11.2023

## User requirements:

The client's company needed a user-friendly script that could extract 
information from YouTube videos. They weren't interested in a basic 
AI-powered summarization, as it often misses crucial details. 

## My solution:

I came up with the idea of making a basic terminal script that lets you 
paste a YouTube link. After that, you can ask questions, and the script 
will try to answer them using the video's content. To make sure the 
answers are legit, it'll also show you the part of the video where it 
found the information.

## Review by Bobby:

I rarely write reviews, but this one is necessary. I was searching for a 
solution for a long time and when I met Arthur, I found it. Initially, I 
didn't even know what I wanted, but Arthur helped me with everything. 
Moreover, the order was completed quickly, efficiently and relatively 
cheaply. I would definitely recommend him.
